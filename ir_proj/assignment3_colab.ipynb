Your task is to implement any missing parts of the code and answer any questions (if exist) within this notebook. This will require understanding the existing code, may require reading about packages being used, reading additional resources, and maybe even going over your notes from class ðŸ˜±\n",

        "**Evaluation and auto-grading**: Your submissions will be evaluated using both automatic and manual grading. Code parts for implementation are marked with a comment `# YOUR CODE HERE`, and usually followed by cell(s) containing automatic tests that evaluate the correctness of your answer. Staff will allow your notebook to **execute from start to finish for no more than 90 seconds**, then manually assess your submission. Any automatic tests that did not run due to your notebook timing out **will automatically receive 0 points**. The execution time excludes initial data download, which will already exist in the testing environment. The staff reserves the right to **modify any grade provided by the auto-grader** as well as to **execute additional tests not provided to you**. It is also important to note that **auto-graded cells only result in full or no credit**. In other words, you must pass all tests implemented in a test cell in order to get the credit for it, and passing some, but not all, of the tests in a test cell will not earn you any points for that cell. \n",

        "One of the fundamental data structures in spark is a **Resillient Distributed Dataset (RDD)**. It is an immutable distributed collections of objects that are partitioned across machines, and thus making parallel processing natural and easy. RDD's support two types of operations: *transformations* (e.g. selecting a subset of fields from each element or projecting each element from A->B), and *actions* (e.g. save to disk or `collect` elements into the master node's memory). Watch out for `collect` operations that send too much data to the master node, it will crash without a trace because of running out of memory. \n",

        "Spark employs **lazy-evaluation** (like many of us...), meaning that it accumulates things we ask it to do into an execution plan, but doesn't do any calculation until a result is actually needed. When a result is needed? when we save something to disk, ask spark to show the data, or use other actions. But make no mistakes, Spark is not a slacker. It employs lazy-evaluation because it allows optimizations that wouldn't be possible otherwise and it often saves users from unnecessary data reads, tranfers across machines, and other costly operations. As we will see in a bit, the RDD data structure lends itself to simple and efficient MapReduce operations."
